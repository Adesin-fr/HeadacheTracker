## Headache tracker

This is a quick Laravel application (php/Mysql or wathever DB you want !) to allow to track headaches.


### Installation

Clone project anywhere you want, and run `composer install` inside it to download dependencies.
Then edit .env file (copy .env.example to get a starting model) to suit your database.
Once done, do `php artisan migrate` to create tables. 
At least, point your web server "document root" to `/public` folder.
